Neither of us care about your tinder profile pics, nor about any of your personal details — all we want to do is get a sense of the media pages y'all follow. \r\n\r\nPrivacy policy: This isn't going out to marketers (ugh!) or being monetized (money — the worst!). In fact, we don't even care about your name. All we want to do is find out which news organizations you follow on Facebook. \r\n\r\n",
